Size: 20
Average execution time (C): 0.003400 seconds
Average execution time (Assembly): 0.003467 seconds

Analysis: since the values are quite short they won't have any significant differences with their execution time.


Size: 24
Average execution time (C): 0.054233 seconds
Average execution time (Assembly): 0.053833 seconds

Analysis: with the significantly larger value compared to the previous one we are still in the margin of error of their execution time but assembly being a bit more faster compared to C



Size: 28
Average execution time (C): 0.935133 seconds
Average execution time (Assembly): 0.910233 seconds


Analysis: As the size increases, the C implementation may become less efficient due to memory access patterns, while the assembly implementation's fine-grained control may lead to more stable and potentially faster performance.
